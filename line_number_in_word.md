# Add Line Number in Word Doc on Mac

## Step 1: In the doc that is opened

Go to `Layout` tab in Word (on macOS)

Go to `Line Numbers` option

Choose `Continuous`. Line numbers will appear.

## Step 2: In Word's root menu

To format the line number, go back to the root menu of Word

Go to `Format` tab, choose `Style`

In the dialog box, for `Styles` section, pick `Line Number` from the list

Click `Modify` to open up the dialog box for changing its format

My usual format is: `Calibri` for font, `8` for font size, and a light gray color. 

Click `OK` to save the changes and then `Apply` to make the new format effective and close all the dialog boxes.
